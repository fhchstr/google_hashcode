# 2018 Qualification Round
Millions of people commute by car every day; for example, to school or to their workplace.
Self-driving vehicles are an exciting development for transportation. They aim to make traveling by car safer
and more available while also saving commuters time.
In this competition problem, weâ€™ll be looking at how a fleet of self-driving vehicles can efficiently get
commuters to their destinations in a simulated city.

## My implementation
I decided to rate each ride and give them a score for each vehicle, based on its location (=intersection) and time (=step). A ride with a high score is a ride which:
* has a long distance
* is close to the current intersection
* starts in a reasonable time (or started already)

Bonus points are rewarded if the ride starts exactly on time, so it's worth waiting a few steps (but not too many) for the ride to start.

This is implemented using a heap because it's a very efficient data structure to get the ride with the best score.

Once a ride gets assigned to a vehicle, the score of all the other possible rides must be re-calculated based on the new location and step of the vehicle. This must only be done for the vehicle which got a new ride assigned to him. The position/step of the other vehicles didn't change, so the score of their rides didn't change either.

### Score calculation
A good score is a low (negative) score because a min-heap is used.
```
investment = transit_time + waiting_time
reward     = distance + bonus

score = investment - reward

  - score < 0:  reward is bigger than the investment
  - score == 0: reward is the same as the investment
  - score > 0:  reward is smaller than the investment


good
----
distance: distance of the ride
bonus: points awarded if the ride starts on time

bad
---
transit_time: number of steps required to move from the current position to the start of the ride
waiting_time: number of steps spent waiting for the ride to start
```

### Scheduling

To schedule the rides as efficiently as possible, the ride with the best score among all the vehicles is scheduled next.
This is also implemented using a heap. This one contains only the best score of each vehicle.
```
while rides still not assigned:
    take the ride with the best score among all the vehicles
    assign it to the corresponding vehicle
    re-calculate the score of all the rides for this vehicle
```

## Result
Here is how you can run the script for each data set.
```bash
$ mkdir -p output;
for f in data_sets/*; do \
    start=$SECONDS; \
    echo -n "${f}: "; \
    python hashcode.py $f > "output/$(basename $f .in).out"; \
    echo "in $(($SECONDS - $start)) seconds";
done
```
Here is the output (the files to submit are in the `output/` directory.
```
data_sets/a_example.in: score: 10
in 0 seconds
data_sets/b_should_be_easy.in: score: 175352
in 0 seconds
data_sets/c_no_hurry.in: score: 15385206
in 309 seconds
data_sets/d_metropolis.in: score: 10854665
in 174 seconds
data_sets/e_high_bonus.in: score: 20557945
in 264 seconds
```
Total: **46973178** points which corresponds to rank 530/3012 ([Scoreboard](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive/2018)).

## Improvements
* The score formula is pretty naive and doesn't prioritize the rides which must be finished early
* Instead of "just" taking the ride with the best score, some smart brute-force could be done
  * Bulding a graph and using a shortest path algorithm is probably a good solution
