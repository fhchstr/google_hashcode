Programming is fun! [Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/) is a great resource to train and solve new problems.
As an exercise, I tried to implement some of the archived problems. Alone, without looking for other solutions online.

My solutions are for sure not the best, but that's not the point. My goal is to be able to implement an good enough solution.
